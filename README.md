# React-SPA-Starter
___

### Goal 💪
A starter template for beginner to build a Single Page Application(SPA) with React, which includes basic features but requires dependencies as little as possible.😊

### Basic Features 👀
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) <- one way data binding
- [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) <- routing
- [Express Router](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html) <- api/other modules, not in react component because i wanna remain the flexibility to includes other modules
- [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) <- hot reloading for debug

### Why? 🤔
As a beginner, I just wanna make a SPA with React, but there are so many hindrances because there are too many react starter kits out there.😩 They include so many dependencies/snippets which you may not know why(it just works)🙄, this is very painful for continuous development because you don't know what can be changed/removed.🤕

### Wish 😌
Any pull requests to minimize the codebase are welcome.🙏 If you want more features which may not be necessary, please open an issue 🙋 or consider fork.🍴

### Cautions ☝
This repo is not for experts,🤓 you may find that I haven't includes any functionalities like uglyfy, gzip...whatever🤗 for optimization, because I just wanna make things simple, easy to maintain and deploy without pain for beginners.👶
